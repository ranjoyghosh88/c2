				p	Account ID
				p	Profile picture
				p	Social media information
				p	Payment card information
				p	Depending on the service we are providing to you we may also need to collect more sensitive personal information (such as location information, payment card information, government-issued identification number) directly from you
				p	If you submit any personal information relating to other people, to us or to our service providers, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use their personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice. 
				p	We and our service providers may collect personal information from a variety of sources, including: 
				p	From you: We may collect personal information you elect to share with us such as your name or preferred means of communication.

We may also receive your personal information from people with whom you are "friends" or otherwise connected on social media platforms.  For example, if you elect to connect your social media account to your CSquire Services account, certain personal information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include personal information that is part of your social media profile or your friends’ profiles.  The reverse is also true if your social media "friends" connect their social media account to their CSquire Services account.

					li	Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies
					li	IP address
					li	Location data
					li	Aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified information
					li	Demographic information and other information provided by you (i.e., language, occupation, postal code)
					li	We and our third-party service providers may collect this information in a variety of ways, including: 
					li	Through your browser or device:  Most browsers and devices collect certain information automatically, for example, type and version of operating system, screen resolution, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the CSquire Services (such as the app) you are using.  We use this information, for example, to make sure that the CSquire Services function properly, analyze the performance of our products, and improve and maintain the CSquire Services and products.
					li	Through your use of a CSquire app:  When you download and use an CSquire app, we and our service providers may track and collect usage data, such as the date and time the CSquire app on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the CSquire app.
					li	Through cookies and similar technologies:  We use cookies to make our web sites operate, work more efficiently, and provide analytic information. Technologies similar to cookies are also used in connection with some CSquire Services. A cookie is a piece of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as a tag that identifies your computer to give it a sort of anonymous user ID that resides in your computer.  The cookie may store web site statistics, user preferences, information about your browser, and other identifying information.  You can set your browser in most instances to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it or not. You can also generally set your browser preferences so that your computer cannot accept cookies.  Certain web site pages and features (including any feature that requires you to sign in before using it) will not function properly if you choose to disable the acceptance of cookies.
					li	IP Address: IP addresses are automatically transmitted, as part of any Internet communication, and collecting IP addresses is a common practice; many web sites, applications and other CSquire Services collect IP addresses automatically.  We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels of the CSquire Services, helping diagnose server problems, security, and administering the CSquire Services.
					li	Location Data:  We may collect the physical location of a connected device, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals. We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based CSquire Services, content and advertising. We may also share your device’s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. You can choose whether to allow or deny uses and/or sharing of your device’s location by changing your device settings, but if you choose to deny such uses and/or sharing, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized CSquire Services, content and advertising.
